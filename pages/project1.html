        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>The prompt generator website for designers and those 
            in the STEM field, Sharpen, does not have a mobile 
            app version accessible to users.

    <div class="solution">
        <p>How do we make an effective mobile app version of

        <h4>Project Goals</h4>
        <p>With the mobile app I'd create, the goals revolved around 
            the person who would be finding design prompts for a new 
            project.  Most likely designers or people in the STEM 
            field.

        <h3>Learning more about the users</h3>
        <h4>Key insights from user research</h4>
        <p>To learn more about those looking for inspiration, 
            I sent a survey to a targeted set of designers and 
            inventors. I then took the responses through a 
            card-sorting exercise to find common themes 
            amongst the respondents.

        <h3>Insight #1</h3>
        <h4>Where do I go?</h4>
        <p>The site offers many other free generators 
            that can't be accessed on the main dropdown 
            menu shown in the header.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
        <p>Result: The mobile app will allow users to

            on an easily accessible page.

        <h4>Save it for later</h4>
        <p>Prompts can not be saved for later use through 
            the site directly. Users have to take screenshots 
            of prompts or jot them down manually.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution2">
        <p>Result: Users will be able to save prompts and

        <h3>Insight #3</h3>
        <h4>Never miss a beat</h4>
        <p>When browsing for new challenges, users would accidentally 
            skip the prompts that they were considering.
        </p>

    <div class="solution3">

        <p> To keep a concise order, I mapped out how users would access 
            each page in the mobile app version using sticky notes. 
            I started by drawing out how each page on the web version 
            is accessed. This allowed me to make the appropriate decisions 
            on how users would navigate the app easily.

        <h3>How will I Design?</h3>

        <p>Due to not having access to Sharpen's design system, 
            I created a UI kit that closely resembled the fonts, 
            colors, typography, and many more elements shown on the webpage.

        <p>Creating a UI kit that correlated with Sharpen's 
            original design required researching the site's 
            functionality. I instituted transitions similar 
            to what's shown on Sharpen's website between the

                <h4>Too many options</h4>
                <p>From the information architecture survey, 80% 
                    of testers would go to the generators page 
                    to access what they wanted use. This lead me 
                    to remove the STEM generator option from the 
                    footer navigation. The 'generators' page was 
                    enough for users to distinguish where to find 
                    the STEM generator as it was also accessible 
                    through the dropdown menu in the header.

                <p>What if the list of a user's saved prompts leads to
