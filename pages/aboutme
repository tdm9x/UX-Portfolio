        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p class="amp1">
            After graduating with my Bachelorâ€™s in English, 
            I knew for sure that the career I would like to have had to 
            have some creative aspect within it. 
            While researching different career fields for English majors, 
            I ran across UX design and started learning how to become a
            UX designer by enrolling in Google UX Design Certification Course.
        </p>

        <p class="amp2">
            I hope to utilize the knowledge and 
            skills acquired from this certification 
            to attain an entry-level position and begin my career.
        </p>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p class="motivp1">
            One of the most motivating things I have 
            discovered about myself this past year is 
            that I am capable of anything I put my mind 
            to. For me, a learning curve is nothing 
            more than an opportunity to get better at 
            something.
